  Kaylene Barrera presented progress on Site-1-Protease (S1P) in the pathogenesis 
  of Acute Pancreatitis.  S1P deficiency leads to inability to compensate for ER 
  stress conditions associated with pancreatitis, and thus greater acinar cell 
  injury making it a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of acute 
  pancreatitis. This project received <span style="color: #FF9F1C">1st place in 
  the Basic Sciences competition</span>. Congratulations Kaylene!
