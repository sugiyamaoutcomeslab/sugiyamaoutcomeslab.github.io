    Several Downstate residents and medical students participated in this yearly
    event. The broad spectrum of research topics presented included disparities 
    in breast and colon cancer, outcomes in robotic and minimally invasive 
    hernia repair, the cost efficacy of reusable laparosopic instruments, and 
    molecular signaling in acute pancreatitis. ABC News Correspondent, 
    Deborah Roberts, was the invited guest speaker. Sara Kim was awarded 
    <span style="color: #FF9F1C">first prize</span> and Michael Smith received
